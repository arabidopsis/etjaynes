    > Kahneman & Tversky claimed that we are not Bayesians, because in psychological tests people often commint violations of Bayesian principles. However, this claim is seen differently in vliew of what we have just noted. We suggest that people are reasoning according to a more sophisticated version of Bayesian inference than they had in mind.
